### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently a second year undergraduate student in De La Salle University (DLSU) studying Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with specialization in Software Technology (BS CS-ST). I had my primary education in Holy Child College of Davao (HCCD) and graduated from my secondary education from Davao Christian High School (DCHS) class of 2019 (STEM). Please visit the education page if you want to know more.

My main research interest lies in **Natural Langauge Processing (NLP)** and **Computer Vision (CV)**. As of time of writing, I reviewed some research papers on the topics and reading up on machine learning techniques. However, no hands-on work has been made so far. On the other hand, my main development skill set leans more into Full Stack Web Development (esp Back-end), DevOps, & Computer Software Development.

## Current Projects

### Personal Projects
- Cuss-Net : A Python-TensorFlow Neural Network for English, Filipino, & Taglish Sentiment Analysis

If you want to contribute some sentences for this project, that is highly appreciated! You may submit sentences [here](https://forms.gle/XrDCEFSLVYdCFUjH6). If you want to contribute hands-on to this project, you may send me an [email](mailto:adriel@adrielamoguis.com).

### Organization Projects
- Lasallian Youth Orchestra Infrastructure
  - I'm currently working on an organization-wide infrastructure for the Lasallian Youth Orchestra along with my fellow teammates **Lorenzo Querol**, **Gian Madrid**, **Carissa Bartolome**, & **Jon Llamado**.
